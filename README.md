Sentiment Analaysis is a crucial aspect of Natural Language Processing and is becoming increasingly important in various applications such as 
chatbots and information retrieval.  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a popular type of recurrent neural network that has shown great success in many NLP
tasks, including semantic analysis.

This project aims to develop a model that can classify the sentiment of a given text into Positive, Negative or Neutral by the application of NLP and LSTM.
